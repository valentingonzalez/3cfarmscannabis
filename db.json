        "description": "<p>3C Illuminati OG is a direct cut from Josh D’s 1996 Club 33 OG phenome and makes up the genetic backbone of many west coast cannabis varieties. In spite of its ubiquity, its origins remain a debatable mystery (as its name suggests). The colas are a blend of beautiful green tones and its scent is fresh and piney. Illuminati’s denseness hits the tongue with a blast of pine and a touch of tar, just to be followed by a subtle floral sweetness. Its effects set in very quickly, starting with a relaxation that begins at the crown of the head and melts over the entire body.</p><h5>DISPENSARY DESCRIPTION</h5><p>3C Illuminati OG is a direct cut from Josh D’s 1996 Club 33 OG Phenome and makes up the genetic backbone of West Coast cannabis varieties. In spite of its ubiquity, its origins remain a debatable mystery—much like its namesake. The buds are a blend of beautiful green tones, ranging from bright lime greens to deeper piney shades, with auburn pistons. It’s scent is fresh and piney, followed by a waft of sweetness. It’s flavor acts much in the same way—The Illuminati’s dense smoke hits the tongue with a blast of pine & a touch of tar, just to be followed by a subtle floral sweetness. The effects of this heavy Indica onset very quickly, starting with a relaxation that begins at the crown and melts throughout the entire body. An instant classic.</p>",
